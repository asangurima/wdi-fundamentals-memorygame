	<h3>Are you ready for a memory game? <br> Are you like an elephant who never forgets or a goldfish who forgets in a blink of the eye?</h3>
	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p class="InstructionText">The game is fairly simple and you've probably played before. <br>
		Memory is a card game in which all of the cards are arranged face down and two cards are flipped face up each turn.
		The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards and remove them from the play area.
		When all of the cards are matched and the play area is clear- you've won!
